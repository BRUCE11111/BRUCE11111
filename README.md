🔭 I’m currently working on Deep Learning Compiler at Intel. 

😄Programming Languages:

* Proficient in C++ including template metaprogramming

* Experienced with Python, Java, x86, RISCV asm.

⛹️‍♂️My C++ skills are particularly valuable for DL compiler development, especially in:

* Implementing IR optimizations (e.g., loop transformations(tiling))
* Hardware-specific kernel generation (e.g., vectorization, operator fusion，software pipeline)
* Memory reuse optimizations in computational graphs.
* Some common data-flow optimization passes based on SSA, like global scope constant folding, LICM etc.

🍎Deep Learning Expertise:

Mainly in NLP Domain:
* Word Embeddings: word2vec
* Recurrent Architectures: RNN, LSTM
* Transformer Models: Transformer architecture
